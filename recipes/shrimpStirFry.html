        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Every home cook should have a few easy stir fry recipes in their back pocket for quick weekday meals. I like stir fries that have just a few ingredients, a simple sauce, and can be cooked from start to finish in around 20 minutes. This shrimp and mushroom stir fry checks all those boxes and is a nice change of pace from a standard chicken and vegetable stir fry.</p> <br> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> 12 ounces cremini mushrooms, quartered or sliced</li>
                <li> 1 pound large shrimp (31-35 per pound), peeled</li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li> 3 scallions, chopped</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>For the simple stir fry sauce
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Serving and garnish
            <ul>
                <li>Cooked white rice, to serve</li>
                <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the stir fry sauce:<br>Whisk together the chicken stock, garlic, soy sauce, and cornstarch in a small bowl. Set aside</li><br>
            <li>Cook the mushrooms:<br>In a large skillet or wok over medium heat, add olive oil and mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms soften and turn brown in spots around the edges, about 8 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Add the shrimp:<br>Once the mushrooms are cooked to your liking, add the shrimp to the skillet. If the skillet is very dry, add a fresh drizzle of oil to it to ensure the shrimp doesnâ€™t stick. Cook, stirring constantly, until shrimp are cooked through and no longer translucent, 2-3 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Finish the stir fry:<br>Once shrimp are cooked, add all the stir fry sauce to the skillet and stir to combine. The finished sauce should just coat the stir fry ingredients, almost like a thin gravy. If the sauce thickens too much, stir in extra water by the tablespoon. If the sauce is too thin, let it simmer for 1-2 minutes and it will thicken. Lastly, stir in the chopped scallions.</li><br>
            <li>Serve:<br>Serve the shrimp stir fry spooned over cooked white rice garnished with sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
