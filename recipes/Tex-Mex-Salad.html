    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine salad ingredients:<br>Combine the lettuce, red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, and scallions in a large serving bowl. Set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Char the corn:<br>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a medium or large heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the corn.<br>Season corn with 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until blackened in spots and tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li><br>
            <li>Season the chicken:<br>Sprinkle the taco seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon salt over the surface of the chicken, rubbing it in and coating so chicken is fully seasoned.</li><br>
            <li>Cook the chicken:<br>In the same skillet used to cook the corn add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook until deeply brown along the bottom and the flesh turns opaque about halfway up the side, 4 to 5 minutes.<br>Flip the chicken and continue cooking, until brown on the second side and fully cooked through, another 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Cut the chicken:<br>Transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board. Once it is cool enough to handle, cut into bite-sized pieces.</li><br>
            <li>Make the salad dressing:<br>Place the lime juice, vinegar, honey, cumin, salt, pepper, cilantro, and olive oil into a blender and blend until smooth. Add 1 tablespoon of water, if needed, to get the blender going.<br>Alternatively, make this dressing by hand. Finely chop the cilantro and place in a medium bowl. Combine all salad dressing ingredients and whisk until smooth.</li><br>
            <li>Finish and serve the salad:<br>Add the corn and chicken into the bowl with the salad ingredients. Crumble the tortilla chips over the top.<br>Add about two-thirds of the dressing and toss to lightly coat. Add more dressing and toss again, if needed. Divide salad into 4 bowls, top with crumbled Cotija cheese, and serve.</li>
